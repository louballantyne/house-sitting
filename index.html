  <h2>Looking after the parrots</h2>

  <p>There are 5 Green-Cheeked conures and 2 African Greys.</p>

  <h3>Green-Cheeked Conures:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Rio (cage on his own)</li>
    <li>Rolo and Toto (next to Rio) – Toto has yellow on his belly</li>
    <li>Caesar and Pixie – Pixie has yellow on her belly</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>African Greys:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Echo (biggest cage)</li>
    <li>Smokey</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Feeding Schedule:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>They all have an unlimited amount of pellets in their pens. If these run out, top them up.
      <ul>
        <li>Rio tends to make his a bit gross by mushing up fresh food in there. If it gets gross, remove and discard it.</li>
        <li>The conures eat Harrisons Lifetime Fine pellets.</li>
        <li>Smokey eats Harrisons High Potency Coarse.</li>
        <li>Echo is a fusspot and currently eats Harrisons High Potency Fine made into a mush with hot water. Also offer Lafeber Gourmet pellets.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Morning routine:
      <ul>
        <li>Remove seed bowls from the greys.</li>
        <li>Remove and wash Echo’s mushy pellet bowl.</li>
        <li>Wash all food and water bowls.</li>
        <li>Replace water and change newspaper.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>While bowls are drying, offer pre-breakfast:
      <ul>
        <li>Little piece of toast for everyone.</li>
        <li>Echo may prefer scrambled egg or toast.</li>
        <li>Fresh fruit and vegetables (washed in a sieve):</li>
        <ul>
          <li>7 sugar snap peas</li>
          <li>3 slices of carrot</li>
          <li>About half a tin of sweetcorn</li>
          <li>2 baby corns</li>
          <li>2 big slices of pepper</li>
          <li>A thick slice of beetroot</li>
          <li>Broccoli</li>
          <li>Pomegranate seeds (4 each for conures, 8 each for greys)</li>
          <li>6 grapes (half each for small birds)</li>
          <li>Optional: apple or other fruit</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>This is a rough guide! They can have more or different amounts.</li>
    <li>Evening feeding (~5pm):
      <ul>
        <li>Conures get a Nutriberry.</li>
        <li>Greys get seeds:
          <ul>
            <li>Echo: very small amount from two seed bags.</li>
            <li>Smokey: larger amount from the bag closest to the door (labelled).</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Evening routine:
      <ul>
        <li>Shut dark blue blinds on French doors and between dining room and kitchen (between 6–8pm).</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Bribery</h3>
  <p>All birds can be bribed! Use what helps. Tips:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Caesar: bribed with toast or nutriberries (give Pixie some too).</li>
    <li>Smokey: bribed with toast.</li>
    <li>Echo: loves scrambled egg (kept in fridge, can be microwaved in glass jug).</li>
    <li>To get birds back into their pen, show their favorite food going into it.</li>
    <li>Rolo and Toto: best lured back with safflower seeds, toast, or nutriberries.</li>
    <li>Caesar, Pixie, and Rio: bribed with all of the above.</li>
    <li><strong>Important:</strong> Do not let conures from different cages out at the same time—they will fight!</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Pixie</h4>
  <p>5 years old. Flighty but sweet. May fly onto you. Breathing may sound funny after flying due to old nostril damage. Will fight with Toto and Rio.</p>

  <h4>Rolo</h4>
  <p>8 years old. Not hand tame but may sit on your head or hand for seeds. Follows Toto.</p>

  <h4>Toto</h4>
  <p>7 years old. Confident. May fly to your shoulder. Escape artist—sneaks through food doors. Nest-obsessed. Will fight with Caesar, Pixie, and Rio.</p>

  <h4>Echo</h4>
